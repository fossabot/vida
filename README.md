Vida is a media server built with Golang and VueJS

## System Requirements
1. Docker and Docker Compose

## Run Everything


## Status
Still a WIP but the following works. Right now we can retrieve metadata about movies in a directory using IMDB

1. Make sure the databse is running
```bash
make db
```

2. Run Migrations
```bash
make migrate-up
```

3. Make sure you have a directory with movies with `movie-name.mp4` for the movie names. To test, you can generate fake movie files with
```bash
make data
```

4. Get movie metadata (if you have a directory with movies, you can pass it to the dir flag below)
```bash
go run main.go media search --type movie --dir ./data
```

5. Check your db, it will have metadata for your movies. (POSTGRES: 5432, user: vida, password: vida, database: vida)

...ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ

## CLI
The following commands are available to use (before the UI is built)
```bash
# search for media in a specific directory and add the metadata to your database
# type can be "movie" or "series" depending on what is contained in the --dir passed
# only movie supported for now.
./vida media search --type="<type>" --dir="dir" 
```

## GRPC
Vida comes with a GRPC Server which you can use to test. To be able to test the GRPC server you need to have a grpc tool installed. There are 
many tools out there, but I decided to use the [GRPC CLI tool](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md).

You also need to have [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) command line installed. (`brew install protobuf`)

To get started, make sure you run: (not needed as the generated code is on the repo, but this generates the protobuf code)
```bash
make proto
```

Make sure both the [DB and the Migrations](#developer-environment) are running and the start the GRPC server
```bash
make server-grpc
```

To search for movies, get the path where your local movies are stored, and run
```bash
grpc_cli call localhost:50005 MoviesRequests.SearchMovies "path: '<path/to/your/media>'"
```

To list the movies whose metadata has already been collected, run
```bash
grpc_cli call localhost:50005 MoviesRequests.ListMovies ""
```


## Developer Environment
In case you want to set this up for developments, you can use the following steps.

### 1. Run migrations
Before running migrations, make sure the database is up and running
```bash
make db
```

Migration files in Vida are just `.sql` files and in this case they have a dialect for `postgres`. To create new migration files
run
```bash
make migrate-create name="change_to_sql_schema"
```

This will create two new files `<timestamp>_change_to_sql_schema.up.sql` and `<timestampe>_change_to_sql_schema.up.sql` representing the up and down
migrations respectively.

To run the up migrations, run:
```bash
make migrate-up
```

To run the down migrations, run:
```bash
make migrate-down
```

To rollback the previous migration, run:
```bash
make migrate-rollback #should be able to capture steps as a parameter soon
```
